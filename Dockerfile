# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Stage 1: build the toon_rust encoder (`tru`).
#
# The Python runtime can shell out to a `tru` binary to encode payloads in
# TOON format (`format='toon'` on any tool call). Without `tru` on $PATH the
# code path silently falls back to JSON. The image used to ship without a
# TOON encoder at all, so every `format='toon'` request from a container
# deployment was silently downgraded — see issue #163.
#
# We build the encoder from source pinned to a specific ref (default: main)
# so the container's TOON output matches a known toon_rust commit, then copy
# the single binary into the runtime stage. The crate name on cargo install
# is `tru` but the [[bin]] target name is `toon`, so we rename on copy.
# (Renaming the target upstream is tracked separately; this Dockerfile is
# tolerant of either name today.)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# toon_rust pins nightly via rust-toolchain.toml. Install rustup into a
# stable Debian base, let the toolchain file drive channel selection — that
# way this builder stage tracks whatever toon_rust pins without us having
# to bump a hard-coded image tag every nightly cycle.
